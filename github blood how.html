			<p style="font-size: 35px;">How Blood IS used</p><br><br><br>
			<p style="font-size: 15px;">Blood or the components of blood are used to treat patients with medical conditions such as anaemia, cancer blood disorders, and those having surgery.</p><br><br>
			<p style="font-size: 35px;">Blood Components</p><br>
			<p style="font-size: 15px;">Blood is made up of a number of components, including red blood cells, platelets and plasma. Each of these can be used to treat many different conditions.<br>

Blood is usually separated into its individual components or parts, so a patient can be given the particular component they need.<br>

This makes the most of every blood donation, as the components in one unit of blood (or one donation) can be used to treat different patients.</p><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 35px;">Blood Transfusation</p><br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">Donated blood or components are given to a patient in a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are given via an intravenous line into a blood vessel.</p><br><br>
